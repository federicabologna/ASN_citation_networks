# WIP: 2016-18 National Scientific Qualification citation networks

Repository for facilitating the analysis of the citation networks of the candidates who took part to the second section of the 2016-18 NSQ for recruitment fields 10/G1 and 13/D4. 
The bibliographic and citation data of each candidate and of their commission is transformed into a citation network. The blue dots represent the candidate’s publications, the red dots represent the commission’s publications and the green dots represent the publications co-authored by the candidate and at least one member of the commission. Dots in grey represent the number of co-citations and bibliographic couplings between a publication of the candidate and one of the commission: the darker the dot, the higher the number of occurrences.
